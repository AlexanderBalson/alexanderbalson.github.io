# Let the Days Go By

A game by Alexander Balson. Inspired by a minigame I was working on, and 'Once In a Lifetime' by the Talking Heads, I made this game over the course of a couple of weeks in my free time. 

### The Goal of the Game

Being an average man, your goal is to get a well paying job, a nice car, a beautiful house and a beautiful wife. Walking through the place you've found yourself, you will be presented with yes or no choices that will determine your success. 

### Controls

Use WASD to walk around, mouse to look, Y and N keys to decide.

### Credits

Credits to come on alexanderbalson.com soon.
